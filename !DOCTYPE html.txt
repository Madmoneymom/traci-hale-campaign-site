    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>With a double MBA in Public Administration and Business Management, I bring both systems-level insight and practical strategies to the Prichard City Council.</p>
    <p>As a mom and neighbor, I <strong>work hands-on with church and community youth</strong>, listening to their needs and lifting up their voices alongside yours.</p>
    <p>My commitment is to put people first — to listen, lead with integrity — and fight for safer streets, stronger local businesses, and services that truly serve District 3. I’m not here to talk at you — I’m here to work with you.</p>
